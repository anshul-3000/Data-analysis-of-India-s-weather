# India's Weather Data Analysis (2020-2021)
Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data for India from 2020 to 2021. The analysis is performed using Python and its data analysis libraries to uncover insights into temperature variations, precipitation levels, and humidity trends. The findings are visualized through various plots and graphs to better understand weather patterns and correlations.

## Project Details
#### Dataset: The dataset includes daily weather data for different regions in India, covering temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
#### Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
#### Objective: To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the weather data and present key insights through visualizations.
## Features
#### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, data type conversions, and data normalization.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes statistical summaries and correlation analysis.
## Visualizations:
#### Line graphs for temperature trends
#### Scatter plots for precipitation vs. temperature
#### Histograms for humidity distribution

## Installation
#### Navigate to the project directory:
cd india-weather-analysis

#### Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Place your weather data file (e.g., weather_data.csv) in the project directory.

#### Run the analysis script:
python weather_analysis.py
The results will be saved in the output/ directory as images and summary reports.

# India's Weather Data Analysis (2020-2021)
Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data for India from 2020 to 2021. The analysis is performed using Python and its data analysis libraries to uncover insights into temperature variations, precipitation levels, and humidity trends. The findings are visualized through various plots and graphs to better understand weather patterns and correlations.

## Project Details
Dataset: The dataset includes daily weather data for different regions in India, covering temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Objective: To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the weather data and present key insights through visualizations.
Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, data type conversions, and data normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes statistical summaries and correlation analysis.
Visualizations:
Line graphs for temperature trends
Scatter plots for precipitation vs. temperature
Histograms for humidity distribution
